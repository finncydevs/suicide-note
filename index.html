    This is no one fault, this death is pure because of the hatred i have towards myself. 

I'm sorry to disappoint all of my closest family, its not like i dont believe anyone's love me but rather i dont believe anyone could ever love me.

Im living with high expectations towards myself and that's the problem, I have problems with my own self and it is hard to resolve and this is the only way for me to solve it.

Im happy enough with this life, everyones been great to me but I havent, and im sorry for everything its not like im not greatful but i don't feel like i deserve all of this.

My suicide is inevitable sooner or later i will do it, and now i think is the time for it.

i hate goodbye but i guess i need to say it. good bye everyone i hope you guys been great to yourself. ive again lost the battle.

NOTES: only nina who knows my pin and she also my phone has a finger print of her. nothing there tho, delete everything if you could
